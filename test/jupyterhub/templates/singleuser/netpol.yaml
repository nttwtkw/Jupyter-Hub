  # IMPORTANT:
  # NetworkPolicy's ingress "from" and egress "to" rule specifications require
  # great attention to detail. A quick summary is:
  #
  # 1. You can provide "from"/"to" rules that provide access either ports or a
  #    subset of ports.
  # 2. You can for each "from"/"to" rule provide any number of
  #    "sources"/"destinations" of four different kinds.
  #    - podSelector                        - targets pods with a certain label in the same namespace as the NetworkPolicy
  #    - namespaceSelector                  - targets all pods running in namespaces with a certain label
  #    - namespaceSelector and podSelector  - targets pods with a certain label running in namespaces with a certain label
  #    - ipBlock                            - targets network traffic from/to a set of IP address ranges
